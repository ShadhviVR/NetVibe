          <p>
          Netvibe provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content ("Netvibe content") over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("Netvibe ready devices")</p>.

<p>The Netvibe service is provided to you by Netvibe International B.V. These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netvibe service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized digital content service provided by Netvibe for discovering and accessing Netvibe content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Use indicate the member who created the Netvibe account and whose payment method is charged.</p>
<br/>
<h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Membership</h3>

<p>1.1. Your Netvibe membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netvibe service you must have Internet access and a Netvibe ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).</p>
<br/>
<p>1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Netvibe membership by visiting the Netvibe.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.</p>
<br/><h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Promotional Offers.</h3> We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by Netvibe at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netvibe membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netvibe membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to you.
<br/><br/><h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Billing and Cancellation</h3>

<h4 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">3.1. Billing Cycle.</h4> The membership fee for the Netvibe service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the Netvibe.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. If you signed up for Netvibe using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netvibe membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

<br/><br/><h4 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">3.2. Payment Methods.</h4> To use the Netvibe service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

<br/><br/><h4 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">3.3. Updating your Payment Methods.</h4> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

<br/><br/><h4 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">3.4. Cancellation.</h4> You can cancel your Netvibe membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Netvibe service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused Netvibe content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Netvibe using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netvibe membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netvibe service through that third party.

<br/><br/><h4 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans.</h4> We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.

The time it takes to begin watching Netvibe content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and the configuration of your Netvibe ready device.</p>

<br/><p>4.8. Netvibe software is developed by, or for, Netvibe and may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access Netvibe content through Netvibe ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices. You acknowledge that the use of the service may require third party software that is subject to third party licenses. You agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the Netvibe software and related third-party software.

<br/><br/><h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Passwords and Account Access.</h3> Your password is for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. If you allow others to access the account (which includes access to information on viewing activity for the account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf and that you are bound by any changes that they may make to the account, including but not limited to changes to the subscription plan. To help maintain control over the account and to prevent any unauthorized users from accessing the account, you should maintain control over the devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You agree to provide and maintain accurate information relating to your account, including a valid email address so we can send you account related notices.
